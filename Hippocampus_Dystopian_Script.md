## **FADE IN:**

**INT. MEMORY ARCADE – NIGHT**

Neon light flickers across metal floors slick with condensation.  
A faint *clack-clack-clack* reverberates — mechanical jaws echoing through the dark.

Above a set of sealed glass doors glows a bright holographic sign:

> **“HUNGRY HUNGRY HUMAN™ — FEED THE HIPPOCAMPUS.”**

Inside, massive biomechanical *hippos* are fused to the floor — slick metal, muscle, and circuitry intertwined.  
Each is tethered by cables to *human contestants* reclined in chrome thrones, eyes rolled back, skull jacks pulsing.

---

### **NARRATOR (V.O.)**
> In the year 2149, hunger was solved.  
> Not for food — but for *thought.*

---

**CAMERA TRACKS** down the rows — each hippo’s throat glowing with swallowed memories: swirling spheres of light, each one a stolen recollection.

The crowd chants from behind a glass partition.

> “CHOMP! CHOMP! CHOMP!”

---

### **ANNOUNCER (O.S.)**
🎙 *“Round 12: Memory Harvest — Family, Faith, and First Love!”*

The hippos rear back.  
Metallic jaws open.  
Neural tendrils *snap taut.*

---

## **INT. GAME FLOOR – CONTINUOUS**

Each player’s body spasms as streams of colored light — memories — rip from their skulls and fly into the waiting mouths of their assigned hippos.

**SCOREBOARD FLICKERS:**

> **RED HIPPO — 32 REMEMBRANCES**  
> **BLUE HIPPO — 41 REMEMBRANCES**  
> **GREEN HIPPO — 28 REMEMBRANCES**  
> **YELLOW HIPPO — STARVING**

---

**PLAYER 4 (YELLOW HIPPO)**  
(whispering weakly)  
> Please... I just need one more happy one...

A faint laugh — the memory of a *child’s giggle* — flickers from their forehead.  
The yellow hippo lunges— *CHOMP.*  
The light is gone.

---

### **NARRATOR (V.O.)**
> The hippocampus was once where we kept our past.  
> Now, it’s where the past keeps *us.*

---

## **INT. CONTROL ROOM – ABOVE THE GAME FLOOR**

Behind mirrored glass, executives in sleek biotech suits observe the match.  
They sip translucent cocktails infused with glowing particles — liquified memories.

**EXECUTIVE #1**  
(leaning forward)  
> How’s the retention rate?

**TECHNICIAN**  
> Below forty percent.  
> Subjects are forgetting how to breathe between rounds.

**EXECUTIVE #1**  
(smiles)  
> Then they’ll never remember to rebel.

**EXECUTIVE #2**  
> The audience numbers?

**TECHNICIAN**  
> Climbing. Everyone loves a feed.

The crowd below erupts as another hippo devours a blue sphere.  
A human memory dissolves into static applause.

---

## **INT. PLAYER 4 NEURAL FEED – INTERNAL**

Inside Player 4’s mind — broken glass images of childhood, oceans, a mother’s hand — all flicker and fade to static.  
A single neuron *flares* back to life.  
The feedback loop reverses.

---

### **SYSTEM VOICE (GLITCHED)**
> **ERROR: MEMORY FEED — DIRECTION REVERSED.**

The hippo *shudders.*  
Light surges backward through the cable and slams into Player 4’s skull.

---

**PLAYER 4**  
(gasping, awakening)  
> No more feeding.  
> You’ve eaten enough.

---

The hippo’s metallic frame twists and *unfolds* into a reflective surface — a mirror made of memory.  
Faces appear in its reflection: every person ever erased by the game.

---

## **INT. CONTROL ROOM**

**EXECUTIVE #1**  
> What the hell is that?

**TECHNICIAN**  
> It’s remembering them back.

The building’s lights flicker. The mirrored glass *shatters outward.*

---

## **INT. GAME FLOOR – CONTINUOUS**

Players across the floor jolt awake.  
Memory pools overflow, flooding the arena with glowing light.

Each hippo now mirrors its player’s face — millions of them — all whispering:

> “I remember. I remember. I remember.”

The scoreboard burns out.  
The chant of the crowd dies.

---

### **NARRATOR (V.O.)**
> And in the end, the only way to starve the beast...  
> is to stop playing.

---

## **FADE OUT**

The neon sign flickers through the smoke:

> **“INSERT MEMORY TO CONTINUE.”**

Then darkness.

---

# **THE END**
